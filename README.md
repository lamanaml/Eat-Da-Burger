## Overview
 
Eat-Da-Burger is a Node Express app that uses mySQl as the database, and uses handlebars to serve the page.  This restaurant app lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

I could not get the app to deploy on Heroku
