Eat-Da-Burger is a Node Espress Restaurant app that uses mySQl as the database, and uses handle bars to serve the page.  It lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

 Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
